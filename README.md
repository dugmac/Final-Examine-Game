# Final-Examine-Game
Final project for Intro to IT

The adventure will be the playerâ€™s final examine before graduating from Adventuring School. The adventure will require players to move through a dungeon, solve puzzles and riddles to finally reach the end. This will be more of a thinking adventure than a combat one.
Players will find and collect items as they explore the dungeon. Some items will be needed to proceed in the dungeon, and some will not. There will be a finite inventory for the player so they will need to decide what items they think they will need to keep and what items are not needed.
